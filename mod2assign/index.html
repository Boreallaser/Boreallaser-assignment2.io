        <p class="main">
          Our vegan menu are made up of only plant-based foods. This type of
          menu includes fruits, vegetables, soy, legumes, nuts and nut butters,
          plant-based dairy alternatives, sprouted or fermented plant foods and
          whole grains. Our vegan menu don’t include animal foods like eggs,
          dairy, meat, poultry or seafood. They also are devoid of animal
          byproducts such as honey (made by bees) and lesser-known animal-based
          ingredients like whey, casein, lactose, egg white albumen, gelatin,
          carmine, shellac, animal-derived vitamin D3 and fish-derived omega-3
          fatty acids.

        <p class="main">
          Yes we have dry aged beef. Do you know, before the invention of
          refrigeration, dry aging (whether it was in a chamber, a cellar or a
          cave) was one of the only methods of keeping meat fresh, other than
          smoking, brining or pickling? It is a time honoured technique that
          both enhances the flavour and tenderness of meat. In essence, dry
          aging is when you take a piece of meat and put it into a controlled
          open-air environment to go through a flavour transformation. By
          exposing the meat to air, moisture is pulled out and the natural
          enzymes in the beef break the muscles down slowly over time, making it
          more tender. When the surface of the beef dries, it creates a crust
          over the muscle, but what’s inside stays moist and red.
